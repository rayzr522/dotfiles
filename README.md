# dotfiles

> My personal dotfiles for *nix.

Please keep in mind that some of these scripts / configs are things that I made years ago and have yet to update with all of my new scripting knowledge. Additionally, not everything will work on everyone's system, although I am trying to make these scripts as portable as possible (since I want to be able to automatically deploy my scripts to new machines in the future!).

## Other Personal Scripts

These are other personal scripts / tools that I made which I use in conjunction with the config files that are here.
